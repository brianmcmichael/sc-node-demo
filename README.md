# sc-node-demo

Launch a private node locally

Step 1: install [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installing-Geth)

Step 2: Download the installation script and make it executable:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianmcmichael/sc-node-demo/master/safechain-node.sh
chmod +x safechain-node.sh
```
Step 3: Run the script several times until the node starts. The script will advise you at each run what it has done.
```
./safechain-node.sh
```
